Introduction
This repository was created as part of IBM's "Developing Front End Apps with React" course.
A React application was created as a final project: Paradise Nursery Shopping Cart App.

With this application, users can select plants in an online plant shop and add them to the shopping cart.

The user receives feedback when making a selection, which improves the user experience.
See, for example, the grayed-out button on selection or the number of products in the shopping cart at the top right.

If necessary, the quantity can be increased or decreased.
